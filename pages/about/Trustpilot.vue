                Excellent and experienced guide Oscar was a wealth of knowledge and fun to travel with.
                The airport pickup and departures were smooth and well organized. Hotels were all of good
                quality though some were a distance from the cities visited. Lunch/dinner buffets were
                fairly repetitive in content, but you could always find something good and one never goes
                hungry. The vehicle used, a minibus, was modern, clean and “Fati” was a safe and excellent
                driver. There are some quite long driving days to cover so much territory, but in 10 days
                you will have seen many of Türkiye’s most famous and beautiful sights. Very good value for
                money and a responsive and communicative travel company to work with. I look forward to
                future adventures with TravelShop.

                Had the opportunity to do a tour with Travelshop Turkey to Cappadocia and Istanbul. It was
                awesome, from the pickup experience. The Gamirasu hotel in Cappadocia was an experience on
                its own. The layout at breakfast was absolutely delicious, the service excellent. Our tour
                guides made the trips fun and informative. The personal touch that Travel Shop Turkey put to
                their tours makes the tours fun and worth it. I will always recommend Travel Shop for any
                tours and am looking forward to my next trip. Thank you Travel Shop Turkey,
